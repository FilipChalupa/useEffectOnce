```tsx
const Component = ({ data, isFetched }: { data?: Record<string, string>; isFetched?: boolean }) => {
  useEffectOnce(
    () => {
      // This will get executed once the 3rd argument is `true`, and then never again
      // if no 3rd argument is passed, then it'll only run once, on mount

      return () => {
        // This will still run on unmount
      };
    },
    [data, isFetched],
    !!data && isFetched,
  );

  return <>{...JSX}</>;
};
```

### `.eslintrc.js`

Given that you're utilising the `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` `eslint` rule.

In order to get the `eslint` validation to work, we need to add the following to the `.eslintrc.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  ...
  rules: {
    ...
    'react-hooks/exhaustive-deps': [
      1,
      {
        additionalHooks: '(useEffectOnce|useLayoutEffectOnce)', // I'm the important part üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
      },
    ],
    ...
  },
};
```
